# Fractol - 42 School Project

Welcome to **Fractol**, a captivating journey into the mesmerizing world of fractals, where mathematics meets art through the power of computation. This project, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum, is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of fractal geometry, brought to life with code. Whether you're a math enthusiast, a programmer, or simply someone who appreciates visual artistry, Fractol invites you to explore the infinite intricacies of these mathematical wonders.

Fractals are more than just stunning visualsâ€”they are a testament to the elegance of mathematics and its profound connection to the natural world. Through this project, I aimed to channel my passion for both mathematics and computer science into creating a tool that not only generates fractals but also inspires curiosity and creativity.

## Main Notions Learned

- **Mathematical Foundations**: Deepened my understanding of complex numbers, iterative functions, and the mathematical principles behind fractals like the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
- **Graphical Programming**: Gained hands-on experience with graphical libraries (e.g., MiniLibX) to render dynamic and interactive visualizations.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Learned to optimize algorithms for real-time rendering, balancing performance and precision.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Explored the intersection of art and technology, using code to create visually stunning outputs.
